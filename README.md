# zouxian 走线

中文版请见[这里](https://github.com/CatMe0w/zouxian/blob/master/README_zh.md)。

Apple restricted the access to Apple Intelligence and Xcode LLM (Predictive Code Completion) feature on China models of Mac. That is, if you are using a Mac bought in China, even if you are not in China, you will not be able to use Apple Intelligence or Xcode Predictive Code Completion.

If you are unfortunate to be in this situation, now it is time take your Mac on a journey of _[Zouxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouxian_(phenomenon))_.

Persistent solution after rebooting, based on [Cyandev's guide](https://gist.github.com/unixzii/6f25be1842399022e16ad6477a304286).
